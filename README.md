This is an experiment in creating a system for automatically generating documentation and/or previews for other interactive projects. Experiments added to this project should have preview posts generated from them, and be posted (and updated?) at [pxctrl.tumblr.com](http://pxctrl.tumblr.com/). The plan is to at least generate some kind of Tumblr-dashboard-viewable "demo" of any little JavaScript experiment … think GIF, or maybe MP4 … we'll see.
